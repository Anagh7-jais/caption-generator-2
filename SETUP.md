# Google AI Integration Setup

## üöÄ Your React app now has Google AI integration!

The app has been successfully updated to use Google's Generative AI (Gemini) for content generation instead of mock data.

## üîë API Key Setup

To use the AI features, you need to set up a Google AI API key:

### Step 1: Get your API Key
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key

### Step 2: Create Environment File
1. Create a `.env` file in your project root
2. Add your API key:
```
VITE_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## ‚ú® What's New

- **Real AI Generation**: Uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model
- **Dual Modes**: Text-to-post AND image-to-caption generation
- **Image Analysis**: Upload any image and get AI-generated captions

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you see "AI generation failed" alerts:
1. Check your API key is correct
2. Ensure you have internet connection
3. Verify your Google AI account has credits
4. The app will still work with fallback content
